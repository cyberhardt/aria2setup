This list will be updated as I use the program. It was initially supposed to be a list of sites that work, but as 99% of the sites work, it will now be a list of sites that don't work.

This combination (Download With Aria2 browser extension and/or AriaNG) does not work with:

1 - Workupload (workupload.com); doesn't work

2 - Gofile (gofile.io); doesn't work

3 - Mixdrop (mixdrop.co); very slow speeds and only 1 connection
